Consider a maze mapped to a matrix with an upper left corner at coordinates (row, column) = (0, 0). Any movement must be in increasing row or column direction. You must determine the number of distinct paths through the maze. You will always start at position (0, 0), the top left, and end up at (max(row), max(column)), the bottom right.

As an example, consider the following diagram where 1 indicates an open cell and 0 indicates blocked. You can only travel through open cells, so no path can go through the cell at (0, 2). There are two distinct paths to the goal.

PS example
There are two possible paths from cell (0, 0) to cell (1, 3) in this matrix.
Function Description

Complete the function numberOfPaths in the editor below. The function must return the number of paths through the matrix, modulo (109 + 7) (the output should not overflow).



numberOfPaths has the following parameter(s):

    a[a[0],...a[n-1]]:  an array of strings, each representing a row of the matrix where each character represents a column



Constraints

1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, where "n" is number of rows, and "m" is number of columns.
Each cell in matrix a contains either a 0 or a 1.

 
Sample Case

Sample Input

a = ["1 1 1 1", "1 1 1 1", "1 1 1 1"]
Sample Output

10
Explanation

Sample Case 0
There are 10 possible paths from cell (0, 0) to cell (2, 3).
