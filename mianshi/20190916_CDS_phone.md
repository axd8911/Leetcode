## Summary
- Again, be familiar with basic algorithms, basic sortings and their complexity
- Keep C++ another language you can use

## Coding question
### Binary search: whether a number is in a sorted list or not
```cpp
//a[]= -1 3 5 7 8 , X=-1

array<int> my Array = {-1,3,5,7,8};
int X = -1;

int binarySearch(array<int> myArray, size_t N, int X){

    int myStart = 0;
    int myEnd = N;
    while (myStart<=myEnd){

        int mid = (myStart + myEnd)/2;

        if (X==myArray[mid]){
            return mid;
        }
        if (X < myArray[mid]){
            myEnd = mid -1;
        }
        else if (X > myArray[mid]){
            myStart = mid + 1;
        }

    }
    return -1;

}


mystart = 0, myend = 5
mid = 2 ->myArr[mid] = 5
5>-1 -> myend = 1

mystart = 0, myend = 1
mid = 0 -> myArr[mid] = -1
return 0

```

### Write an algorithm such that if an element in MXN matrix is zero its entire row and columns are set to zero.
```cpp

vector<vector<int>> changeZero(vector<vector<int>> myMatrix){
// iterate the items, if we meet an zero, we change all items in its row to -1, and all items in its col to -1
// the matrix has -1, 0, 1, we change all -1 to 0

//iterate all items and write down the zeros' indices including Xs and Ys, then we change all items in these Xs and Ys to zero

// iterate items, when meet a zero and its index is not in the set of (original 1s), we change its row and column, but we keep a set to save the items which were originally 1. const * (M+N)

    int height = myMatrix.size();
    int width = myMatrix[0].size();
    //do not forget if the matrix is empty

    unordered_set<int,int> origOnes {};

    for (int i=0;int i<height; ++i){
        for (int j=0; j<width;++j){
            if (myMatrix[i][j] == 0 and origOnes.find({i,j}) == origOnes.end()){
                // change all items in row and col to zero and note those are orginally ones
                for (int m=0; m<height; ++m){
                    if (myMatrix[m][j] == 1){origOnes.push({m,j});}
                    myMatrix[m][j] = 0;
                }

                for (int n=0;n<width;++n){
                    if (myMatrix[i][n] == 1){origOnes.push({i,n});}
                    myMatrix[i][n] = 0;
                }

            }

        }
    }
    return myMatrix;

}

// when meet a zero, we change its row and col: if original is 0, keep it zero; if original is 1, change it to -1
//time : M*N*(M+N)
```

## Technical questions
- What is mergesort, quicksort. Their time complexity and space
- what is map, search complexity
- what data structure are you familiar with? Do you know C++ STL?
