Due to the work load of ME interviews, I do more easy questions these days.
### 136 Single Number:
  You may choose either less memory, or shorter run time. Hard to get both. Leetcode has a few solutions and it may worth to take a look, especially for the hash table one, and the logic relation one.
### 017 Letter Combination of a Phone Number:
  May check if others have anything faster than O(n**3)  

## 03/21/2019
### 049 Group Anagram:
  Spent a lot of time on comparing letter by letter in strings, while finally figured out that it can be easily solved by dictionary. Each dict key is the sorted string. Then output is the list of values for each key.
### 048 Rotate Image:
  Assign some value to a variable: assign the value itself or assign the memory location?
  One line to loop over lists in list
  Sometimes it is useful to calculate the first few items in hand writing and then try to find the rule or equaion for bigger set.
  Another solution uses zip command in Python. Should learn about how to use it.

## 03/22/2019
Did an interview with Facebook in hardware development

## 03/23/3019
No update. Did some heavy house work.

## 03/24/2019
### 070 Climbing Stairs
  It is a fibonacci list. Like what I found in 048, it is useful to calculate the first few items and find the rules.
  Later, it may be useful to try dynamic programming

## 03/25/2019
Started CC189 study
### 961 N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array
  Not so challenge. a easy question. Easier than what the question describes.

## 03/27/2019
### 066 Plus One
  An easy one. Not much to add.

## 03/30/2019
### 021 Merge Two Sorted Lists
  Useful to understand linked list
  Could do it shorter, see the 5 line python solution in leetcode.

## 03/31/2019
### 028 Implement strStr()
  Another easy question. Pay attention to the concer cases.

## 04/08/2019
### 141 Linked List Cycle
  Another easy question
### 023 Merge k Sorted Lists
  A good practice for linked list address allocation and exchange.
  Sometimes it may be helpful to jump out of a fixed frame. For example, list in this problem will be very helpful.
### 024 Swap Nodes in Pairs
  A good practice for linked list address allocation and exchange. Should repeat it and do some similar ones soon.

## 04/22/2019
### 127 Word Ladder
  BFS question. Needs to pay attention to the defaultdict function.
  Think further about which way is more efficient, when facing with some tedious logic.

## 05/04/2019
### 043 Multiply Strings
  A strange problem. Multiply digit by digit and add them up.

## 05/05/2019
### 034	Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
  Binary search. Try to be more proficient in binary search
### 038 Count and Say
  Normal string problem. Be more careful with boundary conditions
### 046 Permutations
  Similar to 017. It is a backtracking problem. I did not use recursive way, but rescursion should definitely be practised.

## 05/10/2019
### 033 Search in Rotated Sorted Array
  Form a way to do binary search and repeat the way.
  Duplicate the data then do operate. Using pointers and movers is not so efficient.

## 05/11/2019
  Try to understand shallow copy and deep copy!!
  Try to understand shallow copy and deep copy!!
  Try to understand shallow copy and deep copy!!
### 039 Combination Sum
  Backtracking. Very typical question. Should try to deeply understand the circles. Make the circles and loops clear.

## 07/30/2019
### 310 Minimum Height Trees
To be learning the better idea.
### 417 Pacific Atlantic Water Flow
It is BFS. Sometimes if it is hard to solve a problem in normal order, reserve it and think it from backend.


## 08/02/2019
### 079 Word search
Backtracking
There is one way to mark a item you visited: create a set or create a visited list
There is another way: visit it, then change the value, so that later comers cannot find it -- change it back in time if it is still needed in the future.

## 08/03/2019
1st round done with BFS. More harder problems to go.

## 08/04/2019
Start of Greedy algorithm
### 435 Non-overlapping interval
Sort by end so that early item does not impact later ones

### 452 Minimum number of Arrows to burst balloons
Almost the same as 435. As far as it does not go exceed end point, items can be treated the same way.

## 08/05/2019
### 714 Best Time to buy and sell stock with transaction fee
### 309 Best Time to buy and sell stock with cooldown
These stock problems are really a lot of fun. Make clear the dynamic programming in status of each node.

## 08/06/2019
Backtracking
### 526 Beautiful Arrangement
Try to change a direction and see if it can be done faster

## 08/07/2019
Some crucial points in backtracking:
1. When should I use FOR LOOP in backtracking function
2. how to control the flow in Backtracking
3. when should I use self.var when var is an external variable to be used in a function?
4. when to use 'return' and when not to, in a if condition in function
    return means that we are executing for loop and now the for loop finished this and is going next
    typical question 017 letter combinations of a phone number
5. time complexity calculation

## 08/08/2019
Start going through DFS. Make it!!!
### 394 Decode strings
DFS and stack, both works.
isdigit() tells whether a string is all made of numbers

### 473 Matchsticks to Square
DFS: recursion: how to stop it and return the value?
Got it but TLE.
A solution with Python is available. Some DFS thoughts are really amazing. Thinking about a quesiton smartly.

### 494 Target Sum
DFS or DP. It is important to judge which makes the question easier before starting the implementation.
Now i am reviewing DFS, but obviously this question can be solved by DP much easier.
When list takes too long, use dict.
When we need count of some item, use dict instead of list. Are we going to count the amount in the list? No!

## 08/11/2019
Still unsure about DFS return values. Others are fine, needing more practices.
Starting heap
### 974 Subarray Sums Divisible by K
what a amazing prefix sum question. It is the reason that we need to refer to solutions instead of struggling all by ourselves.

### 313 Super ugly number
Now this is a heap question. Pop the smallest number from a list each time.
Knowledge I need to enhance: heap functions, map(), generator, yield

## 08/12/2019
Today let me start the second round of leetcode - following appearance frequency. Expect at least 10 per day.
A summary is needed for each question, with the following bullets.
- my code in another file
- the algorithm I used (could be multiple). The time and space complexity.
- some new coding techs I learned from solutions.
- If I looked at the solution first, mark it.
- If there are extended quesitons, think about them.

a few rules, try to follow
- Try to inspect the code and be bug free, even before submitting
- Come up with test cases all by yourself
- Use English to write down the thoughts
- Use the write board itself to do the draft calculation
